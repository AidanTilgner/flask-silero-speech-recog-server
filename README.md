## Flask Server Audio Recognition

This is a simple Flask server that can be used to recognize audio from a microphone.

It uses Silero models to recognize audio and returns the result as a JSON object.

Check out silero models at https://github.com/snakers4/silero-models

You can get started with this repo by making sure all of the dependencies are installed.
See `requirements.txt` for more information.

Just run `pip install -r requirements.txt` and then you can run `python app.py`.

You'll see the server running on port 5000.

You should now be able to record audio, and on hitting the "Stop" button, you'll see the result.
